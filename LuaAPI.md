# Land of Dran Server Lua API

This documents every function the server-side Lua environment exposes to scripts
(`serverstart.lua` and anything `dofile`'d from it, or run through the eval console).
Generated from the current `LuaFunctions/*.cpp` and `Networking/PacketsFromClient/*.cpp`
source - if you add or change a binding, update this file too.

## Conventions

- Every `Dynamic`, `StaticObject`, and client table has an `id` field (its net ID) and a
  `type` field you can compare against: `1` = Dynamic, `2` = Static, `3` = Client
  (`NetTypes/NetType.h`'s `SimObjectType`). `raycast()` and `client:getCursorItem()` can
  return either a Dynamic or a Static, so check `.type` before assuming which.
- Functions documented as `Expected N arguments` in an error message are strict about
  argument count - passing the wrong number logs an error and does nothing (they don't
  throw a Lua error, so a mistake here fails silently unless you're watching the log).
- Color arguments (`r,g,b[,a]`) are floats in the 0-1 range.
- Mouse button masks (used by `ClientClick`, see below) follow SDL's convention:
  `1` = left, `2` = middle, `4` = right. Check with `(mask & 1) ~= 0`, etc. - more than
  one bit can be set if multiple buttons are held.

## Logging / misc

| Function | Arguments | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `info(...)` | any number of values | Logs a line to the server's info log. Values are stringified (tables holding a Dynamic/Static/Client print as `[Dynamic N]`/`[Static N]`/`[Client N]`). |
| `error(...)` | any number of values | Same as `info`, but logged as an error and prefixed accordingly. |
| `debug(...)` | any number of values | Same as `info`, but only logged when the `logger/verbose` setting is on. |
| `shutdown()` | none | Stops the main program loop (shuts the whole process down, not just the server). |

## Time of day / water

The server owns the time of day and the water level. It sends them to every client once a
second, and right away when one of these functions changes them or a client finishes joining.

| Function | Arguments | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `setTimeOfDay(fraction)` | `fraction`: `0` = midnight, `0.25` = sunrise, `0.5` = noon, `0.75` = sunset. Values outside 0-1 wrap around. | none | Jumps to that time of day. The server starts at noon. |
| `getTimeOfDay()` | none | number, 0-1 | Current time of day, on the same scale as `setTimeOfDay`. |
| `setTimeScale(scale)` | `scale`: in-game seconds that pass per real second | none | A full day is 1000 in-game seconds (`DAY_LENGTH_SECONDS` in `LandOfDran.h`), so the default of `1` is a ~16.7 minute day. `0` freezes time, negative values run it backwards. |
| `getTimeScale()` | none | number | Current time scale. |
| `setWaterLevel([y])` | `y`: world height of the water surface, or no argument / `nil` | none | Puts a water surface at height `y` across the whole world, or removes it when called with no argument. Off by default. Water is visual only: it doesn't affect physics. |
| `getWaterLevel()` | none | number, or `nil` if there's no water | Current water height. |

All of these except the getters use the strict `Expected 1 number argument` check described
above (`setWaterLevel` also accepts no arguments).

## Scheduling

| Function | Arguments | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schedule(delayMS, functionName, ...)` | `delayMS`: milliseconds from now to run; `functionName`: **string** name of a global function; any further arguments are passed through to that function when it runs | schedule ID (number) | Calls the named global function once, after `delayMS` milliseconds. Extra arguments after `functionName` are forwarded to it. Runs are one-shot - call `schedule` again inside the callback for a repeating timer (see `PickupSystem.lua`'s bob loop). |
| `cancel(scheduleID)` | `scheduleID`: value returned by `schedule` | none | Cancels a pending scheduled call before it fires. No-op if it already fired or was already cancelled. |

## Events

| Function | Arguments | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `registerEventListener(eventName, functionName)` | both strings | none | Binds a global function as a listener for a built-in event. Multiple listeners can be bound to the same event; they run in registration order, each receiving whatever the previous one returned (see below), so every listener for a given event must accept and return the same argument list. |
| `unregisterEventListener(eventName, functionName)` | both strings | none | Removes a previously-registered listener. |
| `getNumListeners(eventName)` | string | count | How many functions are bound to an event. |
| `getListenerIdx(eventName, index)` | string, 0-based index | function name (string) | Name of the listener at that index. |

### Built-in events

| Event | Listener signature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ClientJoin` | `function(client) ... return client end` | Fires once a client finishes phase-1 loading (right after connecting). `serverstart.lua`'s `join()` creates and gives them their player dynamic here. |
| `ClientLeave` | `function(client) ... return client end` | Fires when a client disconnects, before it's removed from the client list. Use this to clean up anything the client owned (see `PickupSystem.lua`'s `dropHeldOnLeave`). |
| `ClientChat` | `function(client, message) ... return client, message end` | Fires when a client sends a chat message, before it's broadcast. Return a modified `message` to alter it, or an empty string to suppress it. |
| `ClientClick` | `function(client, posX, posY, posZ, dirX, dirY, dirZ, mask) ... return client, posX, posY, posZ, dirX, dirY, dirZ, mask end` | Fires on every mouse click. `posX/Y/Z` and `dirX/Y/Z` are the camera's position and look direction *at the moment of the click*; `mask` is the SDL mouse button mask (see Conventions). |

| `dynamic:snapToCursor(client, xOffset, yOffset, zOffset)` | client to attach to; view-space offset: `x` = right, `y` = up, `z` = distance in front of the camera | none | Attaches the dynamic to a client's cursor: every physics tick its position is recomputed from that client's live camera position/direction plus this offset, and its gravity is disabled. Calling this again while already snapped just updates the client/offset. |
