--What loadBlocklandSave turns the lights and emitters Blockland saves put on bricks into, run from serverstart.lua after EmitterDefaults.lua
--Blockland's lights are shared types, ours are settings on each brick, so addBlocklandLight gives each Blockland light type the settings
--(the same table as brick:setLight) its bricks' lights start with. Emitters use the emitter type addBlocklandEmitter names, or else the
--one whose uiName is the Blockland name (see EmitterDefaults.lua). Music uses a music sound type with the same name (see newSoundType)

--Blockland lights have a radius and brightness. A Blockland unit is two studs, so a light is made just bright enough to reach twice its
--Blockland radius before our lights cut off (where brightness / (distance^2 + 1) drops under 0.02 of its brightest color channel), then
--scaled by its Blockland brightness over the basic lights' 9. Corona width is its flare's NearSize. blinkSpeed and blinkStrength are
--left out for lights that don't blink, see brick:setLight
local function blocklandLight(uiName, r, g, b, radius, brightness, coronaWidth, blinkSpeed, blinkStrength)
	local reach = radius * 2
	local brightestChannel = math.max(r, g, b, 0.01)
	addBlocklandLight(uiName, {
		color = {r, g, b},
		brightness = 0.02 * (reach * reach + 1) / brightestChannel * (brightness / 9),
		coronaWidth = coronaWidth,
		blinkSpeed = blinkSpeed,
		blinkStrength = blinkStrength
	})

--Light_Animated add-on. Its lights step through keys, A as 0 up to Z as 1, spread evenly over a time in seconds. Ours dim and brighten
--smoothly, so the blinking ones get their full brightness, a cycle as long as the time between their flashes, and a strength from how
--dark they get between flashes. RGB and Alarm animate color and radius, which ours can't, so they get about what they average

--Brightness keys AZQZFZA over 1 second: three flashes a second, dropping to 0, 0.64, and 0.2 between them, which average 0.28
blocklandLight("Yellow Blink", 1, 1, 0, 10, 9, 3, 1 / 3, 0.72)

blocklandLight("RGB", 1, 1, 1, 15, 9, 1)			--Steps through red, green, and blue
blocklandLight("Alarm", 1, 0, 0, 7, 9, 1)			--Pulses red, its radius swinging between 1 and 10
